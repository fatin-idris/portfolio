UX Designer Portfolio
--
Welcome to my portfolio! This project showcases my skills in UX design,  and mechanical engineering. It's designed to provide a comprehensive, intuitive, and efficient experience for recruiters, hiring managers, and potential collaborators.

Key Features
This portfolio is built with the user in mind. Here's a breakdown of the key features and the UX design principles behind them.

1. Sticky Navbar
UX Principle: Navigation Efficiency & User Control.
This feature addresses the UX principle of Navigation Efficiency. By keeping the navigation bar visible as a user scrolls, key links are always within reach. This saves time and provides a seamless way to explore the portfolio without having to scroll back to the top.

2. "More" Dropdown Link
This is a core example of Progressive Disclosure. The "More" link groups less-frequent links into a clean, simple dropdown menu. This prevents the main navigation from being cluttered, allowing the user to focus on the most important links first.

3. Collapsible Skills and Tags
This feature also uses Progressive Disclosure and improves Information Hierarchy. By allowing skills sections to be expanded or collapsed, I've enabled users to quickly scan a high-level overview of my abilities before choosing to see the full, detailed list of tags.

4. Project Modals
The project modals follow the principles of Contextual Information and Non-Disruptive Interaction. Instead of redirecting users to a new page, these pop-ups allow them to view a case study and learn more about a project while remaining on the same page. This maintains their browsing context and creates a more fluid experience.

5. Tooltips
The tooltip on the "More" link and skills section is a small but effective example of Contextual Help. It provides a subtle, on-demand hint about what to expect when clicking, guiding the user's action without being intrusive.

6. Contextual Toast Message
This feature is a prime example of Contextual Engagement. The toast message proactively offers a relevant call-to-action (booking an appointment) at the exact moment a user is most likely to be interestedâ€”when they are viewing my skills or contact information.

7. Direct Resume Link
This link is designed for maximum Task Efficiency. For recruiters and hiring managers, downloading a resume is a primary task, and this feature minimizes the number of clicks required to complete it.

8. Search Functionality
The search bar gives the user Control and improves Findability. It empowers visitors to quickly locate specific keywords, skills, or phrases on the page, ensuring they can find exactly what they're looking for without manual scanning.

9. Visual Consistency
This improvement demonstrates the Aesthetic-Usability Effect. By ensuring all project card images have a uniform height, I've created a more polished, professional, and visually consistent layout. This makes the page easier to scan and enhances the user's perception of the portfolio's quality.




Technologies Used
-- 
Bootstrap: The core framework for the responsive layout and components.
-- HTML & CSS: The foundation for the website's structure and styling.
-- JavaScript: Powers the interactive elements, including the search function, modals, and toast messages.
-- Font Awesome: For all icons used throughout the site.

Future Improvements
-Add more project case studies with high-fidelity mockups.
-Implement a full contact form for direct inquiries.

I hope this overview helps you understand the design decisions and principles behind my work.
